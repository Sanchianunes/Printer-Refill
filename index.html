 <h1>Printer Paper refill</h1>
<p>A step-by-step guide on how to refill printer paper: 
</p>
Step 1: Prepare the Paper<br>
Use the correct paper type and size for printers from the paper storage. <br>
Update the spreadsheet for paper stock.


<p>Step 2: Open the Paper Tray<br>
Locate the paper tray, usually at the bottom for A3 and top for A4 of the printer.<br>
Gently pull it out until fully extended.</p>

<p> Step 3: Adjust the Paper Guides<br>
Slide the paper guides outward to make space for the new paper stack.<br>
Ensure the guides match the paper size markings inside the tray.</P>

<p>Step 4: Load the Paper<br>
Place the paper stack neatly into the tray, ensuring it's aligned properly.
Avoid overfillingâ€”only fill up to the marked limit to prevent jamming.</p>

<p>Step 5: Adjust and Close the Tray<br>
Slide the paper guides back so they fit snugly against the paper stack.<br>
Push the tray back into the printer firmly but gently.<br>
